# What is it?

Stompbox is a guitar amplification and effects application. It is designed to run either under [jack](https://github.com/jackaudio) or as an audio plugin.

This repository is the core codebase. You can find more information about it in the front-end repository [here](https://github.com/mikeoliphant/StompboxUI).

I run it as both a VST3 plugin in a DAW on my PC, and on my Raspberry Pi pedalboard.

Here is a video of it running on my pedalboard:
